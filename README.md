# Reciprocals-of-Primes.py

This small script was inspired by the mathematician [William Shanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shanks) and his big table of reciprocals of primes and their "loop length". I saw this in a [video of Numberphile](https://youtu.be/DmfxIhmGPP4) and was intintrigued enough to try and rebuild the script used in the video without looking at his code of course :)

I have used [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic) to achieve my goal.
